Hey there, I'm Ragavi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm 29 years old and currently live in Los Angeles, CA. 
I've been passionate about programming more than 10 years.
JavaScript is the language I'm most confident to work with and currently I'm studying C++ and CUDA to expand my knowledge in database and machine learning.
